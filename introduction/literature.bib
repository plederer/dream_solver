They are used to absorb and minimize reflections from computational boundaries and as forcing sponges to introduce prescribed disturbances into a calculation.

  abstract = {This study investigates the noise radiated by a~subsonic circular jet with a~Mach number of 0.9 and a~Reynolds number of 65000 computed by a~compressible Large Eddy Simulation (LES). First, it demonstrates the feasibility of using LES to predict accurately both the flow field and the sound radiation on a~domain including the acoustic field. Mean flow parameters, turbulence intensities, velocity spectra and integral length scales are in very good agreement with experimental data. The noise generated by the jet, provided directly by the simulation, is also consistent with measurements in terms of sound pressure spectra, levels and directivity. The apparent location of the sound sources is at the end of the potential core in accordance with some experimental observations at similar Reynolds numbers and Mach numbers. Second, the noise generation mechanisms are discussed in an attempt to connect the flow field with the acoustic field. This study shows that for the simulated moderate Reynolds number jet, the predominant sound radiation in the downstream direction is associated with the breakdown of the shear layers in the central jet zone.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we review and refine the main ideas for devising the so-called hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods; we do that in the framework of steady-state diffusion problems. We begin by revisiting the classic techniques of static condensation of continuous finite element methods and that of hybridization of mixed methods, and show that they can be reinterpreted as discrete versions of a characterization of the associated exact solution in terms of solutions of Dirichlet boundary-value problems on each element of the mesh which are then patched together by transmission conditions across interelement boundaries. We then define the HDG methods associated to this characterization as those using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to approximate the local Dirichlet boundary-value problems, and using weak impositions of the transmission conditions. We give simple conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of their approximate solutions, and show that, by their very construction, the HDG methods are amenable to static condensation. We do this assuming that the diffusivity tensor can be inverted; we also briefly discuss the case in which it cannot. We then show how a different characterization of the exact solution, gives rise to a different way of statically condensing an already known HDG method. We devote the rest of the paper to establishing bridges between the HDG methods and other methods (the old DG methods, the mixed methods, the staggered DG method and the so-called Weak Galerkin method) and to describing recent efforts for the construction of HDG methods (one for systematically obtaining superconvergent methods and another, quite different, which gives rise to optimally convergent methods).

To increase the efficiency of the PML, a pseudo mean flow is introduced in the formulation of absorption equations. The proposed PML equations will absorb exponentially the difference between the nonlinear fluctuation and the prescribed pseudo mean flow. With the nonlinearity in flux vectors, the proposed nonlinear absorbing equations are not formally perfectly matched to the governing equations as their linear counter-parts are. However, numerical examples show satisfactory results. Furthermore, the nonlinear PML reduces automatically to the linear PML upon linearization about the pseudo mean flow. The validity and efficiency of proposed equations as absorbing boundary conditions for nonlinear Euler and Navier--Stokes equations are demonstrated by numerical examples.},

When a vortex is shed  from one side of the cylinder, a negative pressure pulse is generated from that side  whereas a positive pressure pulse is generated from the other side; alternate vortex  shedding from the upper and lower sides of the cylinder produces negative and  positive pulses alternately and thus produces sound pressure waves on both sides.  The dipolar nature of the generated sound is confirmed; lift dipole dominates the  sound field. The Doppler effect is shown to play an important role at finite Mach  numbers. The direct solutions are also compared with the solutions obtained by  Curle's acoustic analogy.

This approach is consistent with the flow physics and transport properties. Based on the theory of characteristics, which is a rigorous mathematical technique, multidimensional flows can be decomposed into acoustic, entropy, and vorticity waves. Nonreflecting boundary conditions are derived by setting corresponding characteristic variables of incoming waves to zero and by partially damping the source terms of the incoming acoustic waves. In order to obtain the resulting optimal damping coefficient, analysis is performed for problems of pure acoustic plane wave propagation and arbitrary flows. The proposed boundary conditions are tested on two benchmark problems: cylindrical acoustic wave propagation and the wake flow behind a cylinder with strong periodic vortex convected out of the computational domain. This new approach substantially minimizes the spurious wave reflections of pressure, density, temperature, and velocity as well as vorticity from the artificial boundaries, where strong multidimensional flow effects exist. The numerical simulations yield accurate results, confirm the optimal damping coefficient obtained from analysis, and verify that the method substantially improves the 1-D characteristics-based nonreflecting boundary conditions for complex multidimensional flows.

In this paper, NSCBC is extended to account for convection and pressure gradients in boundary planes, resulting in a 3D-NSCBC approach. The introduction of these additional transverse terms requires a specific treatment for the computational domain's edges and corners, as well as a suited set of compatibility conditions for boundaries joining regions associated to different flow properties, as inlet, outlet or wall. A systematic strategy for dealing with edges and corners is derived and compatibility conditions for inlet/outlet and wall/outlet boundaries are proposed. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) tests are carried out on simplified flow configurations at first. 3D-NSCBC brings a drastic reduction of flow distortion and numerical reflection, even in regions of strong transverse convection; the accuracy and convergence rate toward target values of flow quantities is also improved. Then, 3D-NSCBC is used for large-eddy simulation (LES) of a free jet and an impinging round-jet. Edge and corner boundary treatment, combining multidirectional characteristics and compatibility conditions, yields stable and accurate solutions even with mixed boundaries characterized by bad posedness issues (e.g. inlet/outlet). LES confirms the effectiveness of the proposed boundary treatment in reproducing mean flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations up to the computational domain limits.},

We present the analysis of sponge/flow interactions and provide a characterization of its basic reflectivity mechanisms. While sponges are perfect absorbers in one-dimensional systems, they can cause their own reflection when encountering oblique sound or oblique vorticity waves. To minimize this adverse effect, sponge strength and profile need to be selected optimally. Also for a fixed desired accuracy, sponge length should be above a minimum threshold. Our analysis quantifies these requirements for a wide range of conditions in terms of inflow/outflow Mach number, incident frequencies, incident angles, and desired accuracy, and covers main concerns with sponges such as sound/sponge interactions and vortex/sponge interactions. As a test case, we present a nonlinear Euler calculation of a convecting vortex interacting with sponges with different lengths. We show that sponges designed by our guidelines achieve accuracies comparable to perfectly matched layers for the same cost, over moderate to high accuracy demands. The results of the presented analysis can be used to determine sponge requirements for a wide range of CFD applications. A summary of these guidelines are listed in the paper.},

  abstract = {We present hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving steady and timedependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in continuum mechanics. The essential ingredients are a local Galerkin projection of the underlying PDEs at the element level onto spaces of polynomials of degree k to parametrize the numerical solution in terms of the numerical trace; a judicious choice of the numerical flux to provide stability and consistency; and a global jump condition that enforces the continuity of the numerical flux to arrive at a global weak formulation in terms of the numerical trace. The HDG methods are fully implicit, high-order accurate and endowed with several unique features which distinguish themselves from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, they reduce the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the solution on element boundaries, thereby leading to a significant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Second, they provide, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of all the variables which converge with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L2-norm. Third, they possess some superconvergence properties that allow us to define inexpensive element-by-element postprocessing procedures to compute a new approximate solution which may converge with higher order than the original solution. And fourth, they allow for a novel and systematic way for imposing boundary conditions for the total stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the methods. In addition, they possess other interesting properties for specific problems. Their approximate solution can be postprocessed to yield an exactly divergence-free and H(div)-conforming velocity field for incompressible flows. They do not exhibit volumetric locking for nearly incompressible solids. We provide extensive numerical results to illustrate their distinct characteristics and compare their performance with that of continuous Galerkin methods. {\'O} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {A methodology to implement non-reflecting boundary conditions for turbomachinery applications, based on characteristic analysis is described in this paper. For these simulations, inlet conditions usually correspond to imposed total pressure, total temperature, flow angles and species composition. While directly imposing these quantities on the inlet boundary condition works correctly for steady RANS simulations, this approach is not adapted for compressible unsteady Large Eddy Simulations because it is fully reflecting in terms of acoustics. Deriving non-reflecting conditions in this situation requires to construct characteristic relations for the incoming wave amplitudes. These relations must impose total pressure, total temperature, flow angle and species composition, and simultaneously identify acoustic waves reaching the inlet to let them propagate without reflection. This treatment must also be compatible with the injection of turbulence at the inlet. The proposed approach shows how characteristic equations can be derived to satisfy all these criteria. It is tested on several cases, ranging from a simple inviscid 2D duct to a rotor/stator stage with turbulence injection.},

  abstract = {We develop numerical boundary conditions for the compressible Navier--Stokes equations based on a generalized relaxation approach (GRCBC), which hinges on locally one-dimensional characteristic projection at the computational boundaries, supplemented with available information from the flow exterior. The basic idea is to estimate the amplitude of incoming characteristic waves through first-order one-sided finite-difference approximations which involve the value of the reference flow state at the first exterior (ghost) point. Unlike other characteristic-based relaxation methods, the present one requires minimal user-supplied input, including the reference flow state, which may be totally or partially known, and in general may vary both in space and time. Furthermore, it can be applied to any type of computational boundary, either inflow or outflow, either subsonic or supersonic. The method is theoretically predicted to convey reduced reflection of waves at computational boundaries compared to other ones, and to have better properties of frequency response to injected disturbances. Numerical tests confirm the improvement of the nonreflecting performance, and demonstrate high degree of flexibility, also for problems with non-trivial far-field boundary conditions (e.g. flows in rotating reference frames) and for the artificial stimulation of subsonic turbulent boundary layers.},

  abstract = {Procedures to define boundary conditions for Navier-Stokes equations are discussed. A new formulation using characteristic wave relations through boundaries is derived for the Euler equations and generalized to the Navier-Stokes equations. The emphasis is on deriving boundary conditions compatible with modern non-dissipative algorithms used for direct simulations of turbulent flows. These methods have very low dispersion errors and require precise boundary conditions to avoid numerical instabilities and to control spurious wave reflections at the computational boundaries. The present formulation is an attempt to provide such conditions. Reflecting and non-reflecting boundary condition treatments are presented. Examples of practical implementations for inlet and outlet boundaries as well as slip and no-slip walls are presented. The method applies to subsonic and supersonic flows. It is compared with a reference method based on extrapolation and partial use of Riemann invariants. Test cases described include a ducted shear layer, vortices propagating through boundaries, and Poiseuille flow. Although no mathematical proof of well-posedness is given, the method uses the correct number of boundary conditions required for well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations and the examples reveal that it provides a significant improvement over the reference method.}

A comprehensive set of relevant numerical benchmarks of viscous and inviscid compressible flows is presented.

The new and improved approach resolves a number of lingering issues of spurious solution behaviour encountered in turbulent reacting flow simulations in the past. This is accomplished (a) by accounting for all the relevant terms in the determination of the characteristic wave amplitudes and (b) by accommodating a relaxation treatment for the transverse gradient terms with the relaxation coefficient properly determined by the low Mach number asymptotic expansion. The new boundary conditions are applied to a comprehensive set of test problems including: vortex-convection; turbulent inflow; ignition front propagation; non-reacting and reacting Poiseuille flows; and counterflow cases. It is demonstrated that the improved boundary conditions perform consistently superior to existing approaches, and result in robust and accurate solutions with minimal acoustic wave interactions at the boundary in hostile turbulent combustion simulation conditions.},
