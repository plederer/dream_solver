## About

The dream package is a python extension for NGSolve that can be used to solve problems from computational fluid dynamics. As a main goal the solver is developed to approximate aero acoustics, e.g. sound waves that are produced by a flow around bluff bodies as can be seen in the following picture.

### Future goals

- Incompressible (wip)
- Easy incorporation of PML and acoustic sponge layers 
-
