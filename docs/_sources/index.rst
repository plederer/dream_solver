Dream-Solver
========================================

This package contains a Python module for `NGSolve <https://www.ngsolve.org>`_ and can be used to solve the compressible
Euler and Navier-Stokes equations by means of an hybrid discontinuous
Galerkin Finite element method. The main emphasis lies in high
fidelity and efficient **d**\ i\ **r**\ ect **ae**\ rocoustic si\ **m**\ ulation (dream).
