### About
---

This is a solver plugin for [NGSolve](www.ngsolve.org) which can be
used to solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations by means of an
Hybrid Discontinuous (HDG) Galerkin method. The main interest lies in
computational aeroacoustics.

Checkout the [documentation](https://plederer.github.io/dream_solver/) (work in progress!) for more information!
