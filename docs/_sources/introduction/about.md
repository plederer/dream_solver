## About
The **dream** package is a Python extension for **NGSolve** designed to address challenges in computational fluid dynamics. Its primary focus is on simulating aeroacoustics, such as the sound waves generated by flows around bluff bodies. The following figure illustrates this phenomenon, showcasing the vorticity of a flow around a cylinder (left) and the resulting induced acoustic pressure waves (right).

Aeroacoustic phenomena near bluff bodies arise due to viscous effects governed by the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The **dream** solver addresses these equations using a (Hybridized) Discontinuous Galerkin method. This approach employs the method of lines, combining a (discontinuous) polynomial approximation with a time-marching scheme.

Although the solver is designed for complex problems, its standout feature is its flexibility and user-friendly interface, enabling straightforward adaptations and modifications.

### Key Features of the **dream** Solver

- Supports arbitrary-order polynomial approximations for conservative quantities.
- Simplifies the incorporation of diverse boundary conditions, including non-reflecting characteristic conditions tailored for aeroacoustics.
- Effortless switching between various pre-implemented Riemann solvers, applicable to both DG and HDG methods.
- Supports fully implicit, explicit, and splitting-based time-marching schemes, offering enhanced flexibility for diverse simulation needs.
- Provides an intuitive interface for capturing critical CFD quantities and streamlining post-processing tasks.

### Future Goals

- Expand capabilities to handle incompressible flows (work in progress).
- Simplify the integration of Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) and acoustic sponge layers for enhanced wave absorption.
- Develop advanced space-time marching schemes tailored for hybridized DG methods.
